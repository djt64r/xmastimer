xmastimer

Created by Davey Toney on 12/20/14

Here is some code I wrote as well as adapted to be used on the Arduino to control Christmas lights.  The user can set the desired number of hours the outlet is on via a push button.  This code could be expanded upon to be used with a 7-segment display which would show the number of hours the user has entered, without the use of the serial monitor.  

I used this code on an Arduino Uno which was part of a basic relay circuit (the specifics of which can be found in various locations online) that controlled two sets of outdoor christmas lights--this involved the use of high-voltage household AC which can be dangerous, but code that follows can't hurt you.
